According to reports, the OLA has launched attacks from a village around 25km from Ataye Town, utilizing heavy weapons. This has caused a panic and fear amongst Ataye residents since yesterday as the fighting is near to Ataye. Due to the unrest near Ataye, nearby residents in Shewa Robit and surrounding areas are likely to have rising fears of potential impending insecurity. Additionally, there are reports of protests taking place today, in Ataye Town and/or near it in Senbete, against the reorganization/disarmament of Amhara Special Forces.",
